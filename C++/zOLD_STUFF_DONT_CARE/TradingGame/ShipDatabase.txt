Speed = (1- Load capacity / Maximum load) * (Ship condition / 100) * (100 - Lifespan elapsed / 100) * Weather condition
Time = Distance / Speed
Load capacity = Number of crew members * 0.1 + Number of cannons * 0.5 + Number of goods
Damage = (Number of cannons * Cannon quality / 100) / (Distance to target * Weather condition)
Income = (Number of goods * Goods value) - (Operating cost * Distance traveled)
Morale = (Number of crew members + Number of battles won - Number of battles lost + Number of rum bottles) / 10
